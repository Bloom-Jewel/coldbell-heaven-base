# coldbell-heaven
This repo used to track issues and reveals some flow on how the thing works.
Some of the files are untouched from how the rails initialized.

## Specification
These are specification guidelines. I **do not recommend** running this on Windows.
It may able to run on lower version, as the specification listed is about what I actually have.

* Software
  * Ruby 2.3.0
  * Rails 5.0.7
* Hardware
  * Linux 14.04

## Database
I'm sorry for this. But it's private for some reason.
The database is generated with my own JSON-to-SQL that specialized for this app.

## Recommendation
use `rvmrc` or something to make a separate gemset for the project.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'coldbell_heaven'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install coldbell_heaven
```

**NOTE**: Remember that this is just for enginefied website.
